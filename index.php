				<h2>IT For the Future of Healthcare: the Scalable Open Platform</h2>
				<img src = "title_img.jpg" class = "titleTopImage" />
				<p>In order to create IT solutions that <em>radically improve a complex work environment</em> such as a modern hospital or a city health network, we need a new paradigm.</p>
				<p>Instead of building software that captures today's data and usage scenarios, then goes out of date, we need a <em>domain-expert modelling factory</em> that continuously delivers models of domain information, processes and user experience, for constant deployment in a <em>platform ecosystem</em>.</p>
				<p>The <em>models are independent</em> of vendor products, and also of particular technologies, giving control back to the users and professionals of the domain.</p>

				<h4>Semantic Architecture</h4>
				<p>Achieving this requires a new kind of software architecture split into two parts: a) <em>domain-level formal languages and tools</em> in which information and work processes can be flexibly modelled and b) an <em>advanced model-execution engine</em>. These are underpinned by terminology and ontology.</p>

				<img class = "titleImage" src="images/home_page_process.svg">
				<h4>Process Orientation</h4>
				<p>All 'work' is done in terms of <em>goal-oriented processes</em>, which respond to an endless stream of real-world events, from customer requests to changes in a patient's heart rate.</p>
				<p>We thus model processes, tasks, plans and data-sets as first-order domain artefacts for deployment in a <em>task planning engine</em> that <em>supports</em> human workflow.</p>

				<h4>Open Platform Thinking</h4>
				<p>Existing major products in healthcare are monolithic private data siloes, blocking users from working effectively.</p>
				<p>The new world is one in which data are managed in openly-specified services, produced by an <em>eco-system of plug-and-play vendors</em>.</p>
				<p>By freeing data to move <em>across enterprises</em>, we free the business.</p>
